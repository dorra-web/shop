【Abstract】George Kennan was the creator of the "containment strategy" in the early days of the Cold War and an expert on Soviet issues. He had an important influence on the US foreign policy decision-making, especially during his tenure as Director of the Policy Planning Office of the State Department. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of Chinese society and history, Kennan saw China as an ancient nation that was "arrogant and xenophobic", "selfish and cold" and "unprincipled" despite its long history and splendid culture. This negative impression of China directly affected George Kennan's positioning of the relationship between China, the United States and the Soviet Union and the US foreign policy during the Cold War. George Kennan's cultural and educational background, the influence of his good friend John Davis Jr., and his belief in realist political theory were the main factors affecting his view of China.

George F. Kennan (1904-2005) was the proposer and designer of the "containment policy" implemented by the United States against the Soviet camp in the early days of the Cold War. He had a direct impact on US foreign policy during his tenure as Director of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department from 1947 to 1949. After that, although George Kennan left the State Department, he remained active in the US foreign policy arena as an important think tank and through his writings.

Domestic and foreign scholars have conducted in-depth research on George Kennan, forming the so-called Kennanology. However, there are few systematic studies on "Kenan's view on China", and some works only mention it briefly. Among them, the more important one is that Paul J. Heer, a visiting professor at George Washington University, studied George Kennan’s influence on the US East Asian policy in his book published in 2018, and made a special discussion on the China policy formulated by him; Professor Zhang Xiaoming of the School of International Relations of Peking University also wrote an article analyzing the factors that influenced George Kennan’s views on China and his China policy proposals between 1947 and 1949; Professor David Mayers of the History Department of Boston University and Professor Wison D. Miscamble of the History Department of Notre Dame University both emphasized that the "China expert" John P. Davies, Jr. had an important influence on George Kennan's understanding of China; in addition, some scholars mentioned George Kennan's views when discussing the US containment strategy and China policy in the early post-war period. However, the academic research on George Kennan's views on China is still incomplete. Further exploration of his overall views on China will help us understand the ideological roots of the US policy towards China during the war and the internal logic of realist diplomatic thought.

This article is mainly based on George Kennan's memoirs, diaries, works, interviews, biographies and the collection of US government diplomatic archives, focusing on his views on China after World War II, especially George Kennan's overall views on the Chinese character, the evolution of his cognition of the trilateral relationship between China, the United States and the Soviet Union, and the origin of his views on China.
